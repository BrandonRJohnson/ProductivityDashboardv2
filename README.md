Productivity Dashboard

What is it?

The goal of this is to create a custom-tool to manage and organize certain aspects of my life. The current functionality is long-term goals, to do lists and projects. Once the base website is where I want it to be I'm thinking of expanding functionality to things like calendar integration and user authenticaiton.

Why this project?

I decided to work on this project coming off the heels of developing my first full-stack CRUD application. That project was very bare bones and was more about understanding the process of connecting the frontend to the backend in a single project. This seemed like a logical step that added some moving parts to the basic CRUD app while providing additional opportunities to improve my skills. I also noticed that I felt that many to do list styled apps that I tried in the past didn't work for me for one reason or another. Being able to completely control the form of the app is a good way of ensuring that it's organized in a way that will be useful going forward.

Running the project?

Plans are to eventually launch the project on herokuapp once it is fully operational with authenticaiton.

Thanks for checking out my project, any feedback is welcome :)
